## Summary | Eat Safe, Love

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, <i>Eat Safe, Love</i>, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
